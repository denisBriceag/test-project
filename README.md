# Book Search Application

This application allows users to search for books by title and author. It features a dynamic search function that updates the results as the user types.

## Features

- **Author Dropdown**: A dropdown menu populated with authors is available. The list of authors is fetched from an API provided by `AppService`.

- **Dynamic Searching**: When the user types a book title in the search field and selects an author from the dropdown, the application makes a request to the mocked api with the entered title and chosen author. The results are then displayed in a table format.

## Testing
Unit tests for `AppComponent` and `AppService`
